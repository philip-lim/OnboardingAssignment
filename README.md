"# OnboardingAssignment" 

This is a web application I created using ASP.NET Core 2.0 and React.js with the help of Entity Framework Core code first approach. We will be creating a sample Store Record Management system and perform CRUD operations on it. To read the inputs from the user, we are using HTML Form element with required field validations on the client side.

We will be using Visual Studio 2019 and SQL Server 2018.
